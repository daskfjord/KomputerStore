Model is currently working

FUTURE REVISION PLANS: 
- move bank functions into bank.js, for readability and making bank data inaccessible outside scope
- move work functions into app.js, for readability and making pay data inaccessible outside scope
- move laptop functions into laptop.js
- condense IF-statements, using switch
- remove surplus functions / join overlapping functions

Assignement will be graded as follows (FROM LECTURE):
  Functionality (10) - Does your project contain the correct functionality as laid out in the instructions?
   Design of logic (10) - How is your code logically laid out? I'm usually not strict with this requirement at all because you're completely new to front end development, so as long as you have some kind of logical structure I'm happy :slightly_smiling_face:
  Standards (5) - Have you used the best practices and conventions that I've spoken about in the lectures? E.g. variable naming conventions, indentation in your code, file names, etc.
  Documentation (5) - Have you documented your project well? This includes comments in your code, and documenting your git repo with a .readme file.
