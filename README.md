# KomputerStore
Assignment for Noroff Accelerate

This assignment is a virtual computer store, containing:
BANK, WORK, LAPTOP choice and display

The model is currently working, allthough code could be optimized
Assignement will be graded as follows (FROM LECTURE):
  Functionality (10) - Does your project contain the correct functionality as laid out in the instructions?
   Design of logic (10) - How is your code logically laid out? I'm usually not strict with this requirement at all because you're completely new to front end development, so as long as you have some kind of logical structure I'm happy :slightly_smiling_face:
  Standards (5) - Have you used the best practices and conventions that I've spoken about in the lectures? E.g. variable naming conventions, indentation in your code, file names, etc.
  Documentation (5) - Have you documented your project well? This includes comments in your code, and documenting your git repo with a .readme file. For comments in your code - I don't need or want you to comment on every single line of code you write. Stick to commenting what methods do, and if you think there's a piece of code that needs a comment to explain it, then include that 
The grade you receive for the assignment will be a mark out of 30 (10 + 10 + 5 + 5) as a %  :100: :100: :100:

SHOULD BE UPGRADED:
All code is currently in app.js
should be seperated into:
app.js, bank.js (handling bank elements), work.js (handling work elements), and laptop.js (handling laptop elements),
then imported. "Sensetive bank information" should be handled by functions, not inline code - will be deducted 1 point if this isn't added.
Last update friday night 21.30 or so
